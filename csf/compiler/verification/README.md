# csfc verification in Lean

`CSFCVerifier.lean` is the compiler-verifier stub. `CSFC.Verification.verify`
returns `Result.notImplemented` for every input. It issues no certificate and
contains no compiler-correctness theorem, `sorry`, or custom axiom.

Build with the version in `lean-toolchain`:

```sh
cd csf/compiler/verification
lake build
```

The next implementation must define the source architecture semantics, the
emitted model semantics, the correspondence to the OCaml compiler output, and
the theorem checked by Lean. Only a completed proof and its audited assumptions
can justify adding a verified result.

The separate [bounded controller proof](../../examples/proof/README.md) checks
its own arithmetic controller model. It does not verify `csfc` or prove runtime
timing, resource cleanup, or physical safety.
