(** Connect a resolved declaration to the files that actually exist.

    Validation has already checked the declaration graph. This pass asks a
    different question: were the claimed implementations inspected, and do
    their selected Go syntax nodes respect their declared process roles?
    For example, merely declaring [source "go/services/x"] cannot cover a
    component if traversal found no production Go file underneath that path.
    No service, subprocess or referenced test is executed here. *)
