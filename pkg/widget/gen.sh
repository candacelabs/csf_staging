# Regenerate every checked-in generated widget in this checkout.
#
# Generated code is committed. That is a requirement rather than a convenience:
# a consumer of this module must be able to `go get` it and build, with no templ
# compiler and no generator binary anywhere on their machine.
#
# The generator is built from this checkout's own pkg/widget/internal/uigen
# rather than fetched, so the generator that produced the committed output is
# always the generator committed beside it. It is a package of the SAME module,
# so what generation needs mounted is the EXPORT ROOT — candace/ — rather than
# this directory. From the export root:
#
#     docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace \
#         dis-gotth-live:latest bash pkg/widget/gen.sh
#
# The image is pkg/gotth's (pkg/gotth/.dis/Dockerfile); it carries the pinned
# templ CLI, which is the only tool this script needs beyond the Go toolchain.
# There is deliberately no second image: two images pinning one templ CLI is two
# places to keep in step, and the version check below already asserts that the
# CLI matches the module's templ runtime.
#
# What it produces, relative to the export root candace/, per widget in the list
# below plus the demo host's own page:
#
#   examples/widget/<widget>/view.templ       the generated templ view
#   examples/widget/<widget>/view_templ.go    its compiled component
#   examples/widget/<widget>/widget.gen.go    the SDK contract implementation
#   examples/widget/page_templ.go             the demo host's own page
#
# The mockgen double at internal/mocks/mocks.go is NOT here, and generate.go
# says why: the image carries no mockgen, and adding a tool to it to regenerate
# a file that changes only when IWidget changes buys a check that fires roughly
# never.
#
# The script is cwd-independent: every path is derived from its own location.
